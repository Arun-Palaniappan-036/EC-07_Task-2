(i) 
**sensor** --> Sound compass senses the direction from which sound is coming.
It uses a circular PCB.
But in our project we cannot keepy anything that is big and circular as we are making a spectacle.
So we replicate the design but the microphones are spectacles.

(ii)
**noise cancellation** --> My method
When the outside signal is transformed into a fourier series, there will be summations of various sines and cosines. We pick the sines and cosines with low frequency out of those and cretate a signal which is exactly anti-phase to the lower frequncies and hence the noise would be cancelled.
